# Clinic Website Project

## About the Project
This project was created as part of my practice in responsive web development using **Bootstrap**.  
The main goal was not only to build the website with **HTML** and **CSS**, but also to apply **Bootstrap** to ensure full responsiveness and a modern design.  

## Theme
The website represents a **clinic**, providing information about services, locations, and contact details.  

## What Was Done
- Started from an open-source **Photoshop (PSD) template**.  
- Transformed the static design into a fully functional and responsive website.  
- Implemented:
  - **HTML5** for structure  
  - **CSS3** for styling and customization  
  - **Bootstrap 5** for responsive layout, grid system, and components  

## Deployment
The project is deployed on **Vercel**:
